There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows. 

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Target Audience ##
  > For social media users and people who like to share their photos with the pulic.

## Summary ##
  > Map-My-Moments is a social media app that allows users to take and view photos from other users based on their current location. When a user takes a photo, a location is attached to that photo and enables other users who check-in to that location later on to access and like the photos.

## Problem ##
  > Users on social media sites like Instagram and Facebook have newsfeed content based on who they are friends with. This means that the content is attached to a user rather than a location.

## Solution ##
  > Instead of requiring users to be friends with someone or to follow others, the content on a user's newsfeed is based on their current location rather than who they are friends with. Depending on the user's location, they are allowed viewing access to the photos taken by other users at that same location. 

## Quote from You ##
  > "I'm excited to connect people with the community by allowing them to see what others are doing within an area!"
  - A really awesome member of the developer team

## How to Get Started ##
  > Install the app, create an account and enable the app to access your current location. Your newsfeed content will refresh to show you pictures taken by other users at your location. Click on the camera button to take a photo and post!

## Customer Quote ##
  > "I love this app because it allows me to see what other people are doing in my area without the commitment of having friends!"
  - Vince 

## Closing and Call to Action ##
  > Tell your friends about the app and start exploring your community to see what's going on!
